# Student Management System (Frontend)

This is the frontend component of a full-stack **Student Management System**, designed to help administrators efficiently manage and oversee student information. The project leverages **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Table View**: Browse and filter student information seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigate between views using React Router.
- **Modal-Based Forms**: Add or edit student details via intuitive modals.
- **Bulk Management**: Select and delete multiple student records simultaneously.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handle large datasets (future updates will include infinite scrolling).

> **Note**: Currently, only the frontend is hosted, as the backend API is under development and undergoing security enhancements.
